    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <p>
      CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to
      style. <br /><br />
      We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
      <br /><br />
      Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
      <br /><br />
      Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship
      between them)
      <br /><br />
      Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
      <br /><br />
      Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
      <br /><br />
      Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute
      value)
    </p>

    <!-- FIFTH WORD -->
    <p class="vocab">Specificity</p>
    <!-- PRONUNCIATION -->
    <p class="pronunciation">[ spes-uh-fis-i-tee ]</p>
    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <p>
      If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same
      element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most
      specific and therefore wins out. <br /><br />
      Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. There are four
      categories which define the specificity level of a selector:
      <br /><br />
      Inline styles - An inline style is attached directly to the element to be
      styled.
      <br /><br />
      IDs - An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, such as #navbar.
      <br /><br />
      Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes - This category includes .classes,
      [attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.
      <br /><br />
      Elements and pseudo-elements - This category includes element names and
      pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, :before and :after.

    <!-- SIXTH WORD -->
    <p class="vocab">class</p>
    <!-- PRONUNCIATION -->
    <p class="pronunciation">[ klas, klahs ]</p>
    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <p>
      The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style
      sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate
      elements with the specific class name. <br /><br />
      The CSS syntax for class is: write a period (.) character, followed by a
      class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}
      <br /><br />
      For Example:
      <br /><br />
      .className
      <br />{ <br />
      &emsp; font-size:12px; <br />}
    </p>

    <!-- SEVENTH WORD -->
    <p class="vocab">id</p>
    <!-- PRONUNCIATION -->
    <p class="pronunciation">[ ahy-dee ]</p>
    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <p>
      The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of
      the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. The id attribute
      is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet.
      <br /><br />
      The CSS syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id
      name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}
      <br /><br />
      For Example:
      <br /><br />
      #idName
      <br />{ <br />
      &emsp; font-size:12px; <br />}
